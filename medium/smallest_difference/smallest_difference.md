# Smallest Difference Explanation

This explanation is based on solving the problem of finding the pair of integers (one from each of two arrays) that have the smallest absolute difference.

## Approach

We aim to identify the pair of integers, one from each array, that minimizes the absolute difference between them. To achieve this, we leverage sorting and a two-pointer technique for efficient comparison.

1. **Sort Both Arrays**: 
   - We sort `arrayOne` and `arrayTwo`. Sorting ensures the integers in each array are in ascending order, which helps minimize comparisons as we progress through the arrays.

2. **Initialize Variables**:
   - `minDifPair`: Stores the pair of integers with the smallest difference found so far.
   - `minimumDif`: Tracks the smallest difference found, initialized to infinity (`float("inf")`).
   - `indexOne` and `indexTwo`: Pointers to iterate through `arrayOne` and `arrayTwo`, respectively.

3. **Two-Pointer Comparison**:
   - Use a while loop to traverse both arrays as long as there are elements left in both.
   - At each step, compare the integers pointed to by `indexOne` and `indexTwo`:
     - If the integer in `arrayOne` is smaller, calculate the difference and move `indexOne` forward.
     - If the integer in `arrayTwo` is smaller, calculate the difference and move `indexTwo` forward.
     - If both integers are equal, return the pair immediately since the difference is zero, which is the smallest possible.

4. **Update the Smallest Difference**:
   - For each comparison, check if the current difference is smaller than the `minimumDif`. If it is, update `minimumDif` and store the pair in `minDifPair`.

5. **Return the Result**:
   - Once the loop finishes, return `minDifPair` as the pair with the smallest difference.

This approach leverages sorting and the two-pointer technique to efficiently minimize the number of comparisons, avoiding a brute-force approach.

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**:
  - Sorting both arrays takes **O(n log n)** and **O(m log m)**, where `n` and `m` are the lengths of `arrayOne` and `arrayTwo`.
  - The while loop traverses both arrays once, taking **O(n + m)**.
  - Overall, the time complexity is **O(n log n + m log m)**.
  
- **Space Complexity**:
  - Sorting is in-place, so the space complexity is **O(1)** (not considering the input).

## Code

```python
def smallestDifference(arrayOne, arrayTwo):
    # Sort both arrays
    arrayOne.sort()
    arrayTwo.sort()
    minDifPair = []
    minimumDif = float("inf")
    indexOne = 0
    indexTwo = 0

    while indexOne < len(arrayOne) and indexTwo < len(arrayTwo):
        integerOne = arrayOne[indexOne]
        integerTwo = arrayTwo[indexTwo]

        if integerOne < integerTwo:
            currentDif = integerTwo - integerOne
            indexOne += 1
        elif integerOne > integerTwo:
            currentDif = integerOne - integerTwo
            indexTwo += 1
        else:
            return [integerOne, integerTwo]

        if minimumDif > currentDif:
            minimumDif = currentDif
            minDifPair = [integerOne, integerTwo]

    return minDifPair

# Example Input
arrayOne = [-1, 5, 10, 20, 28, 3]
arrayTwo = [26, 134, 135, 15, 17]

# Function Call
result = smallestDifference(arrayOne, arrayTwo)
print(f"The pair with the smallest difference is: {result}")
